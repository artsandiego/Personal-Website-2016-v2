#DISCONTINUED

This project was discontinued due to lack of difference from my old portfolio
this was develop to be my second online portfolio to replace my first one, however
during the development pocess of this project I was not sure about the structure and
technologies I should I apply, thus, stoping this project and learning new techs was the best
solution.

#WHAT NOW

I'm actually developing another version of my portfolio and it's one of my repos 
named 'awesm'. this version would be -hopefully- the final version of my portfolio.

If you're interested you can view search it on my repos named 'awesm' thanks.!

#WHY IS THIS STILL HERE?

Well I'm using this repo as my reference and source, nothing else.
